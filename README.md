A site used to test my programming knowledge.

This project will be as far as possible without any use of the framework, using the basic programming language specification to repeat their own wheels! When the wheels are easy to use, I will draw them out and open source into another project. I don't know how long I can hold on to this project, but I will try to extend the life cycle of the project, even though I have been dead in my spare time.

At present, this project uses the Java language the most basic JDBC operation database, using the most basic Servlet and JSP to complete the site page of the jump and page display.

In April 8, 2016, completed the most basic blog function, the page style is still very simple, but also does not support chinese.
